# Quick Start - View Mode Feature

## What's New?

Your HiveOS app now has a **View Mode** system! This lets you organize events, shopping lists, and custom lists into categories like "Personal", "Shared" (if in a group), and custom categories like "Work" or "Family".

## How to Use

### 1. Access the View Mode Dropdown

Look for the dropdown button in the header next to the logout button. It shows your current mode (defaults to "Personal").

### 2. Switch Between Modes

Click the dropdown to see:

- **Personal** - Your personal items (default)
- **Shared** - Items shared with your group (if you're in one)
- **Your custom categories** - Any categories you've created

Click any mode to switch to it.

### 3. Create a Custom Category

1. Open the view mode dropdown
2. Click "+ Add Category" at the bottom
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Work", "Projects", "Family")
4. Click "Create"

Your new category will appear in the dropdown!

### 4. Create Items in Different Modes

1. Switch to the desired mode (e.g., "Work")
2. Create events, add shopping items, or make lists
3. These items will only show when you're in "Work" mode
4. Switch to "Personal" and they're hidden
5. Switch back to "Work" and they reappear!

## Key Benefits

✅ **Organize Without Deleting** - Items stay in the database, just filtered by mode
✅ **Keep Sharing** - Permissions and group access remain unchanged  
✅ **Quick Switching** - One click to see different contexts
✅ **Persistent** - Your last selected mode is remembered

## Example Workflow

**Morning**:

- Switch to "Personal" mode
- Check personal events and shopping list

**At Work**:

- Switch to "Work" mode
- View work events and tasks
- Add work-related items

**Evening**:

- Switch back to "Personal"
- Plan evening activities

**With Family**:

- Switch to "Shared" mode
- See shared shopping list and family events

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Existing Data**: All existing items are set to "Personal" mode by default. They'll appear when you're in Personal mode.

⚠️ **Permissions Unchanged**: View modes only affect what YOU see. Sharing and access permissions work exactly as before.

⚠️ **Mode at Creation**: Items are tagged with whatever mode you're in when you create them.

## Troubleshooting

**Don't see the dropdown?**

- Make sure you're logged in
- Refresh the page

**Items missing?**

- Check if you're in the correct view mode
- Personal mode shows items created in Personal mode only

**Can't see "Shared" option?**

- This only appears if you're part of a group
- Check your group membership in Account settings
